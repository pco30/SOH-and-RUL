A commonly used dataset used for SOH estimation was obtained from a research group at the Center For Advanced Life Cycle Engineering (CALCE) at the University of Maryland, College Park. The dataset comprises CS2 prismatic cells undergoing the same charge profile with a constant current/constant voltage protocol. The designated discharge cut off voltage is 2.7V. The selected cells were subject to a constant current discharge of 0.5C and 1C
